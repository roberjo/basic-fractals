# Fractal Mathematics Guide

## Introduction

This guide explains the mathematical concepts behind the fractals generated by the program. Understanding these concepts can help you better appreciate and explore the patterns you create.

## Mandelbrot Set

### Definition

The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the function:
```
f(z) = z² + c
```
does not diverge when iterated from z = 0.

### Mathematical Properties

1. **Boundedness**: All points in the Mandelbrot set are contained within a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.

2. **Cardioid**: The main body of the set is a cardioid shape defined by:
   ```
   c = (1 - cos(θ))/2 * e^(iθ)
   ```

3. **Periodicity**: Points near the boundary exhibit periodic behavior in their iteration patterns.

### Implementation Notes

- The program uses the escape-time algorithm
- Points are colored based on iteration count
- The escape radius is typically set to 4
- Symmetry is exploited to reduce calculations

## Julia Sets

### Definition

For a given complex number c, the Julia set is the boundary of the set of points z for which:
```
f(z) = z² + c
```
remains bounded under iteration.

### Types of Julia Sets

1. **Connected Julia Sets**
   - c is in the Mandelbrot set
   - Forms a single connected region
   - Often exhibits self-similarity

2. **Disconnected Julia Sets**
   - c is outside the Mandelbrot set
   - Forms a Cantor set
   - Appears as scattered points

3. **Dendrite Julia Sets**
   - Special case when c = i
   - Forms a tree-like structure
   - Exhibits perfect symmetry

### Implementation Notes

- Same iteration algorithm as Mandelbrot
- Different coloring schemes for different types
- Parameter c determines the set's characteristics
- Can be pre-computed for speed

## Sierpinski Triangle

### Definition

The Sierpinski triangle is a fractal formed by:
1. Starting with an equilateral triangle
2. Dividing it into four smaller triangles
3. Removing the central triangle
4. Repeating the process on remaining triangles

### Mathematical Properties

1. **Self-Similarity**: Each part is a smaller copy of the whole
2. **Hausdorff Dimension**: log(3)/log(2) ≈ 1.585
3. **Area**: Approaches zero as iterations increase
4. **Perimeter**: Approaches infinity as iterations increase

### Implementation Notes

- Uses the chaos game algorithm
- Random point selection for efficiency
- Fixed number of iterations (10,000)
- Color based on iteration count

## Color Mapping

### Iteration Count Coloring

1. **Basic Scheme**
   - Black: Inside the set
   - Colors: Based on escape time
   - Modulo operation for cycling

2. **Smooth Coloring**
   - Uses continuous iteration count
   - Logarithmic scaling
   - Color gradient interpolation

3. **Histogram Coloring**
   - Normalizes iteration counts
   - Creates more uniform distribution
   - Better visual representation

## Mathematical Optimization

### Speed Improvements

1. **Early Escape**
   - Test if |z| > 2
   - Use squared magnitudes
   - Avoid square root calculations

2. **Periodicity Checking**
   - Detect cycles in iteration
   - Skip redundant calculations
   - Use lookup tables

3. **Symmetry Exploitation**
   - Mandelbrot set is symmetric
   - Calculate only one half
   - Mirror results
